# Movie App – Development Tasks (Todo List)

This repository contains the development task list for the **Movie App** project completed in the Web Development course at OAMK.
Each task represents a milestone in the project’s progression from a basic React setup to a full backend–frontend application with authentication, routing, and MVC architecture

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document the eight core development steps of the Movie App project.
These tasks guided the implementation of both the frontend and backend and ensured a structured, incremental workflow.

## Development Tasks
### 1. Create Basic App Structure
- Initialize React project
- Set up folder structure
- Add basic components
- Prepare environment for further development

### 2. Create Backend
- Initialize Node.js  + Express backend
- Set up basic routes
- Connect backend to frontend structure

### 3. Automated Testing
- Write basic unit tests
- Test API endpoints
- Ensure stable functionality during development

### 4. Call REST API from React
- Fetch movie data from external API
- Display results in the UI
- Handle loading and error states

### 5. Environment Variables, Routing & Middleware (Backend)
- Use .env for API keys and configuration
- Add Express routing
- Implement middleware (logging, error handling, etc.)

### 6. Authentication & Authorization (Backend)
- Implement user login and registration
- Add JWT or session-based authentication
- Protect backend routes

### 7. Authentication & Authorization (Frontend)
- Add login and signup UI
- Store and use tokens
- Restrict access to protected views

### 8. Model–View–Controller Architecture
- Organize backend into controllers, models, and routes
- Improve maintainability and scalability
- Separate business logic from routing and data handling

## Course Context
